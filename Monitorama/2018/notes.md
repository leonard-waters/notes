- Reflection KEY!
    - Incident reviews, focus less experienced engineers on attending
- Pyschological safety
    - Safe to ask any question!

    - SLO (Objective) - a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI
    - SLA (Agreement) - an explicit or implicit contract with your users that includes consequences of meeting (or missing) the SLOs they contain
